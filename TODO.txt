log render time of each page

Bugs
----
for now there is always re-roll on six, but the rule says off
logout messed up by multiple tabs

Features
--------
detect when game is over
user should be able to leave the game
implement rest of the rule variations
delete game button for owner when it's waiting for players or is over
clean up old games

Code quality
------------
clear up what games a browser has in memory. if it has it, it should receive events, or reload the game when needed
 - to clients on the "browse open games" page
   - broadcast events when a game enters / leaves open_games
   - broadcast join/leave events
refactor common parts of authorization and LudoRules
use common checks in authorization and ui

UX
--
mark the last moved piece: save to server? reload destroys the ghost image
gamelist
 - filtering
 - sorting
 - last active date (last move)
 - more useful information (rules? player list / other details, maybe on hover?)
 - scroll tbody; thead and tfoot should always be visible
game rules
 - save game rule preference
 - preset flavors combinations?
